### **Project Proposal**

**Project Choice**

- Wordle

**Project Description**
My app is called "Wordle-ish". It's a word puzzle game for players who enjoy testing their vocabulary and deduction skills. Each player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback provided for each guess in the form of colored tiles, indicating when guessed letters are in the word or occupy the correct position. The aim is to guess the word in the fewest attempts possible. At the end of the game, players can see their success in guessing the word, and they will have the option to play a new word. In future updates, I plan to introduce a feature allowing players to compete against friends by comparing the number of attempts it takes to guess the word correctly.

**User Stories**

**MVP Goals**

- As a player, I want feedback on each letter of my guess so that I can refine my next guess accordingly.
- As a player, I want my keyboard to grey out incorrectly guessed letters so that I know not to guess them again.
- As a player, I want to know how many attempts I have left to adjust my strategy.
- As a player, I would like to see a summary of my game once I've guessed the word or run out of attempts.
- As a player, I want to know what the word was if I run out of attempts.
- As a player, I want an easy-to-use interface for inputting my guesses to focus on the puzzle.
- As a player, I would like the option to play a new game after finishing one, whether I win or lose.
- As a player, I want a visually appealing and intuitive UI to enhance my playing experience.

**Stretch Goals**

- As a player, I want sound effects for letter inputs.
- As a player, I want to hear different sounds for guesses with correct letters, vs guesses with no correct letters.
- As a player, I want to see confetti if I guess the correct word before running out of guesses.
- As a player interested in improving, I want to see statistics of my past games, like win rate and average attempts.
- As a player, I'd like the option to challenge friends directly with the same word to compare our performance and compete to guess the word the fastest.
